# Assignment 06

In this assignment, there are three tasks:

1) Complete the final teamwork document.
2) Debug a Dash app locally.
3) Deploy the Dash app to Heroku.

## Task 1: Complete project reflection document (10%)

Complete the [teamwork reflection document](https://stat545.stat.ubc.ca/evaluation/teamwork/) for your project.
You will find the Rmd file that you need to fill out in your assignment repo.
DO NOT FORGET to also rate yourself for each question.

#### Grading for Task 1

- This teamwork reflection document is for completion marks only.
- At the end of the course, both teamwork reflection files will be looked at and a final teamwork score will be awarded (worth 10% of the course)
- Please add a link to a viewable teamwork reflection document to your README

### Task 2: Debug a DashR app locally (50%)

For Tasks 2, 3, and 4 you will start with a Dash app that is unknown to you that was written by some former students (Alexander Hinton, Andrea Lee, Dora Qian, and Mike Chen). 
I have received their permission to use and adapt their app for this assignment. 
We took their working app, and introduced 5 bugs that will cause the app not to run.

Your task is find these bugs, debug them, and write 1-2 sentences describing the bug and how you fixed it.
To help you out, I have added some code:

```
### THERE IS A BUG HERE
### START    
% code where the bug exists.
### END
```

The purpose of this task is to help you debug apps in a completely different context than what you have been working with so far.
You will undoubtedly encounter situations like these before and you will need to learn how to read and interpret error messages.
We have given you their deployed app so you know what it should look like when it is fully working.

#### Grading for Task 2

- 10 points for each bug found and fixed correctly
- Partial marks for incorrect or incomplete fixes

### Task 3: Deploy the Dash app (40%)

Once you have the app working locally, you should deploy it on Heroku as described in cm111.
Please provide a link to the deployed dashboard here:

```

#### Grading for Task 3

We will look to make sure:

- all 5 additional files that need to be added in order for deployment to work.
- there is no syntax errors in the files
- all the packages are present
- that you connected and deployed the app correctly
