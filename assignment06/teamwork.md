**Due**: March 21 (for parameterized report project) and April 11 2020
(for dashboard project).

# Team project reflection (10%)

The purpose of this individual report is to give you an avenue to
present your viewpoint as to how the capstone project went, how the
group worked together, and your role in the group. Each group member
must complete this form to report on the contributions of **yourself**
and ypur group partner. That information can, if needed, be used to
adjust final grades of individuals. This is a private report, meaning
that none of your classmates will see this report.

Evaluate yourself and your group partner by writing the number that best
reflects the extent to which he/she participated, prepared, helped the
group excel, and was a team player. Use the following ratings:

| Rating | Description                             |
| ------ | --------------------------------------- |
| 4      | Usually (over 90% of the time)          |
| 3      | Frequently (more often than not)        |
| 2      | Sometimes (less than half the time)     |
| 1      | Rarely (never or once in a great while) |

**Preparation.** Prepared for group meetings; has spent time becoming
familiar with the material relevant for the project; understands the
project’s goal and expectations; does what they say they will do on
time; attends and is on time to group meetings.

| Group member name | Preparation rating |
| ----------------- | ------------------ |
| Diana Lin         | 4                  |
| Nima Jamshidi     | 4                  |

**Participation & communication.** Articulates ideas effectively when
speaking or writing; work is without grammatical errors; listens to
others; encourages others to talk.

| Group member name | Participation & communication rating |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| Diana Lin         | 4                                    |
| Nima Jamshidi     | 3                                    |

**Helps group excel.** Expresses great interest in group success by
evaluating ideas and suggestions; initiates problem solving; influences
and encourages others to set up high standards; doesn’t accept just any
idea but looks for the best ideas; stays motivated from beginning to end
of project.

| Group member name | Helps group excel rating |
| ----------------- | ------------------------ |
| Diana Lin         | 4                        |
| Nima Jamshidi     | 4                        |

**Team player (cooperation).** Knows when to be a leader and a follower;
keeps an open mind; compromises when appropriate; can take criticism;
respects others.

| Group member name | Team player (cooperation) rating |
| ----------------- | -------------------------------- |
| Diana Lin         | 4                                |
| Nima Jamshidi     | 4                                |

Below, briefly describe the specific contribution(s) each team member
(**including yourself**) made to your project. Point form is fine.
Specifically, comment on the following areas:

  - how the team worked together as a whole, including:
      - what was your role in the group? That is, what sort of things
        did you do to contribute to the evolution of the project?
      - what were the roles of others in your group?
  - what went well and poorly throughout the team project experience?

> How did the team worked togetheer as a whole?

I think overall, the team worked great as a whole\!

> What was your role in the group? That is, what sort of things did you
> do to contribute to the evolution of the project?

I think I was ‘group leader’. I instigated most instances of
communication, and organized each milestone into tasks we could divvy
up. (see our closed issues for each milestone\!). I updated and
formatted the README into an full and accessible document to navigate
the repository. In our final project, we went with two tabs, so we each
worked one one tab and that made work distribution pretty much equal
throughout the project. I did the data exploration tab, as well as the
header for the dashboard.

> What were the roles of others in your group?

Nima did the linear regression tab of the dashboard, and also knit our
milestone3 ‘final report’ using bookdown and tinytex. He was able to
knit the document so that all the figures were labelled, numbered, and
hyperlinked\! Nima mostly did what was ‘leftover’ to do for the project,
as a pattern I observed was that I would have time to work on the
project early in/first half of the week (almost immediately after each
milestone was released), but he would not have time until the second
half of the week. So by nature of that, I ended up instigating most
tasks. However, most tasks were done in the order they appear on the
milestone page, so I don’t think the distribution was ever unfair.

> What went well and poorly throughout the team project experience?

**Well:** I really liked the use of GitHub issues and the checklists to
keep track of our progress per milestone, and I would highly recommend
it be enforced for future STAT 547 group projects. I do think that maybe
letting students pick their project partners would be helpful. For me, I
would’ve picked someone in my program, so at least I would see them in
other classes as well, making them easier to communicate. (Especially
since the COVID-19 situation with online classes). I am really glad that
I learned the use of forking and branching, as I have started using it
for my other projects/classes as well :)

**Poorly:** While using GitHub issues was great, I am also in a few
other classes that use GitHub as the primary means for communication.
This means that I have at least 2+ repos that I am a watcher on, and
GitHub emails most DEFINITELY get buried. (In my lab we use JIRA, which
makes my inbox flood that much worse.) And I think this flood of emails
may be the reason I have found it hard to reach Nima sometimes. We are
communicating solely through GitHub issues as it was required for the
group project. I usually do get into contact with him, either the day
of, or day before the deadline, which is cutting it a bit close for my
comfort, but he does always get everything done in time. For example, it
is Sunday evening, and I still haven’t heard from Nima in the past few
days. While I may have time to do the entire milestone myself, I do not
want to do that and leave our work distribution with 100/0, so I’m still
waiting on him. Hopefully we don’t have issues with deployment that
complicate things in the last few hours before deadline.

In class, I know that Firas said that our repository was very well
organized. As I said earlier, I think our `README` is fairly easily to
navigate, and our work for each milestone is tracked. I highly recommend
that future groups use the GitHub issues checklist
    feature:
