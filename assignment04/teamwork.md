**Due**: March 21 (for parameterized report project) and April 4 2020
(for dashboard project).

# Team project reflection (10%)

The purpose of this individual report is to give you an avenue to
present your viewpoint as to how the capstone project went, how the
group worked together, and your role in the group. Each group member
must complete this form to report on the contributions of **yourself**
and ypur group partner. That information can, if needed, be used to
adjust final grades of individuals. This is a private report, meaning
that none of your classmates will see this report.

Evaluate yourself and your group partner by writing the number that best
reflects the extent to which he/she participated, prepared, helped the
group excel, and was a team player. Use the following ratings:

| Rating | Description                             |
| ------ | --------------------------------------- |
| 4      | Usually (over 90% of the time)          |
| 3      | Frequently (more often than not)        |
| 2      | Sometimes (less than half the time)     |
| 1      | Rarely (never or once in a great while) |

**Preparation.** Prepared for group meetings; has spent time becoming
familiar with the material relevant for the project; understands the

Below, briefly describe the specific contribution(s) each team member
(**including yourself**) made to your project. Point form is fine.
Specifically, comment on the following areas:

  - how the team worked together as a whole, including:
      - what was your role in the group? That is, what sort of things
        did you do to contribute to the evolution of the project?
          - Create a GitHub issue to tackle the tasks for each milestone
          - Create a ‘template’ based on the criteria for each report
            `Rmd`
          - Delegate tasks if necessary – I feel like I started the work
            each week, and then my partner just did what was leftover
            and finished it
              - specific tasks done:
                  - keep documentation (`README`) up to date
                  - scripts written: `load_data.R`, `explore_data.R`,
                    `Makefile`, `knit.R`
                  - add manual tests
                  - address feedback from TA
                  - Introduction, About the Data of `milestone1.Rmd`,
                    `milestone2.Rmd`, `milestone3.Rmd`
      - what were the roles of others in your group?
          - update the checklist on GitHub issue for each milestone as
            tasks were completed
          - verfiy that the statistical analysis is sound (I’m not from
            a stats background)
          - specific tasks done:
              - scripts written: `process_data.R`, `linear_regression.R`
              - Methods, Results, Discussion/Conclusion of
                `milestone3.Rmd`
              - adding `bookdown` to `milestone3.Rmd` to allow
                referencing of Tables and Figures
              - knit to `PDF` and `HTML`
  - what went well and poorly throughout the team project experience?
      - **well**: I really like the use of checklists in GitHub issues–
        starting out, I had no idea that they were interactive (as in
        both parties could check/uncheck items)– there is also a
        progress bar for the issue so we know our progress towards the
        due date
          - learned the importance of forks and branches in a
            collaborative GitHub environment, and how to use pull
            requests, etc.
      - **poorly**: we should have made it clear whose job it was to tag
        releases and submit to Canvas each week – that was sort of
        unknown, and I just submitted if there was no submission by
        5:55pm on the night of the grace period due date
          - converting our repo from private to public broke the forks
            and that was a hassle to deal with
      - as group projects go, this one went very well\!
      - I have quite a few classes that are using GitHub, and watching
        4+ repos made it very easy to miss emails and for things to slip
        through the crack
