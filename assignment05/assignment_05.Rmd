# Assignment 05

In this assignment, you will be improving the dashboard you created in assignment 4 by adding callbacks to core features and specifying the dashboard layout.
There are three tasks:
 
- Task 1: Create a plot with two callbacks
- Task 2: Update two plots based on the same input
- Task 3: Create a layout for your dashboard

## Task 1: Create a plot with two callbacks

### Task 1.1: Link dropdown menu to a plot (20%)

- link a dropdown menu from assignment 4 (Task 2.3) to the histogram graph (Task 2.5)
- make sure to add a line with annottaion to a slider explaining what the options mean (you can use `htmlP()` to add this)
- make sure that the histogram also has a title that updates based on what is being plotted

### Task 1.2: Linking radial button to a plot(30%)

- create a radial button that changes y-axis of the histogram from linear/log (*Hint:* `scale_*_continuous()` is a very usefull function for making transformations on the axes)
- link your radial button to the histogram graph in Task 2.5
- both links for task 1.1 and 1.2 should be placed in the same callback
- make sure to add a sentence of instruction on the dashboard to explain what the options mean

## Task 2: Update two Graphs based on the same input (20%)

- use the second plot (of your choice) from assignmnet 4 (task 2.5) 
- now create a scatter or line plot (you can choose what is plotted here)
- using the slider you created in assignment 4, link these two plots, so that both plots change based on the single slider you created
- make sure that both titles have information about what is being displayed on the graph

## Task 3: Create a layout for your dashboard (30%)

You should choose one of the layouts from [this repo](https://github.com/matthewconnell/dashr_sample_layouts) created by Matthew as a starting point.
Apply the layout to your assignment.
